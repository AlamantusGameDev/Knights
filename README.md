# Knights

### A battle card game for two players that uses a standard deck of 54 playing cards.

This project is an attempt to use Phaser to make an HTML5 version of my physical card game of the same name (https://alamantus.itch.io/knights).

## Usage

1. Pull this repository,
2. Run `npm install` while in the root directory to download all the dependencies (it'll take a while),
3. Run `npm run build` to get everything in `/src` minified and runnable into a `/bin` directory,
4. Use `npm run server` to start the ExpressJS server in node,
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the `index.html` file in `/bin`,
6. Profit.
